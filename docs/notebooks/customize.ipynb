    "## Defining new indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "xclim's Indicators are instances of (subclasses of) `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator`. While they are the central to xclim, their construction can be somewhat tricky as a lot happens backstage. Essentially, they act as self-aware functions, taking a set of input variables (DataArrays) and parameters (usually strings, integers or floats), performing some health checks on them and returning one or multiple DataArrays, with CF-compliant (and potentially translated) metadata attributes, masked according to a given missing value set of rules.\n",
    "They define the following key attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the `identifier`, as string that uniquely identifies the indicator,\n",
    "- the `realm`, one of \"atmos\", \"land\", \"seaIce\" or \"ocean\", classifying the domain of use of the indicator.\n",
    "- the `compute` function that returns one or more DataArrays, the \"indice\",\n",
    "- the `cfcheck` and `datacheck` methods that make sure the inputs are appropriate and valid.\n",
    "- the `missing` function that masks elements based on null values in the input.\n",
    "- all metadata attributes that will be attributed to the output and that document the indicator:\n",
    "    - Indicator-level attribute are : `title`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `references` and `notes`.\n",
    "    - Ouput variables attributes (respecting CF conventions) are: `var_name`, `standard_name`, `long_name`, `units`, `cell_methods`, `description` and `comment`. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the [class documentation](../api.rst#indicator-tools) for more info on the meaning of each attribute. The [indicators](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/xclim/tree/master/xclim/indicators) module contains over 50 examples of indicators to draw inspiration from.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metadata parsing vs explicit setting\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, most metadata can be parsed from the indice's signature and docstring. Otherwise, it can always be set when creating a new Indicator instance *or* a new subclass. When _creating_ an indicator, output metadata attributes can be given as strings, or list of strings in the case of indicator returning multiple outputs. However, they are stored in the `cf_attrs` list of dictionaries on the instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "xclim offers the possibility to translate the main Indicator metadata field and automatically add the translations to the outputs. The mechnanic is explained in the [Internationalization](../internationalization.rst) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs and checks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that xclim uses to decide which input arguments of the indicator's call function are considered _variables_ and which are _parameters_. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `_nvar` indicator integer attribute sets the number of arguments that are sent to the `datacheck` and `cfcheck` methods (in the signature's order).\n",
    "- The annotations of the underlying indice (the `compute` method). Arguments annotated with the `xarray.DataArray` type are considered _variables_ and can be read from the dataset passed in `ds`.\n",
